Here we will use a huge amount of transactional sample data. 
We generated a dataset about a hypothetical online storeâ€™s customer success, measuring everything along the whole sales, delivery and customer feedback process
 For this dashboard we create six charts by using five advanced chart types:

*Smoothed Line Chart
Map Chart (only available in Microsoft 365 or Office 2019)
Binary Doughnut Chart
Waterfall Chart (only available in Microsoft 365, Office 2019 and Office 2016)
Normalised Horizontal Bar Chart
For every Pivot Chart, we start by creating the Pivot Table. As a data reference we simply use the name that we defined for our source data table in Step 1. Once the Pivot Table is set up we can drag and drop the required data fields into the rows, columns, and values area of our Pivot Table section. We recommend to have a look at the video at the top to get a better idea and some inspiration on what values make sense for each chart time.
